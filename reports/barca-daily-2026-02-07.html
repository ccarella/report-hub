          <li>Barca beat Mallorca 2-1 at Camp Nou with goals from Lamine Yamal and Frenkie de Jong, extending their La Liga lead to six points</li>
          <li>Flick rotated heavily with the Copa semi-final against Atletico on Wednesday — Fermín López and Pablo Torre both started in midfield</li>
          <li>Muriqi pulled one back late and tested the back line all night; Cubarsi was immense in the air</li>
          <li>Pedri trained with the group today and is expected to be available for the Atletico first leg</li>
          <li>Dani Olmo's contract registration saga finally resolved — the club confirmed his paperwork cleared La Liga's FFP deadline</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are wins that feel like a celebration and wins that feel like clocking out of a shift. Last night's 2-1 over Mallorca was firmly the latter, and that's perfectly fine. <a href="/players/lamine-yamal.html">Lamine Yamal</a> opened the scoring with a curled effort from the edge of the box in the 23rd minute — the kind of goal that makes you forget he's still a teenager — and <a href="/players/frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> doubled the lead before halftime with a trademark late run into the area.</p>
        <p>The second half was more complicated. <a href="/players/vedat-muriqi.html">Vedat Muriqi</a> was a handful all evening, winning aerial duels like a man possessed, and he finally got his reward with a towering header in the 78th minute. The last twelve minutes were nervy — Mallorca suddenly believed and Barca had to defend with purpose. <a href="/players/pau-cubarsi.html">Pau Cubarsi</a> was the standout in that stretch, winning three consecutive aerial challenges and reading the danger before it materialized.</p>
        <p>Hansi Flick's team selection told the real story. With the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg at the Metropolitano on Wednesday, he rested both <a href="/players/pedri.html">Pedri</a> (who's just returned to full training) and Raphinha, handing starts to Fermín López and Pablo Torre in midfield. Neither set the world on fire, but both did enough — kept possession ticking, pressed with energy, didn't give the ball away cheaply. That's the depth Flick has been building all season, and nights like these are when it pays off.</p>
        <p>The bigger news today might have come off the pitch. Pedri was spotted in full team training for the first time since his hamstring setback three weeks ago, moving freely and without any visible discomfort. Flick was characteristically cautious in his post-match presser — "We will see how he feels tomorrow and the day after" — but the body language from camp suggests he'll be in the squad for Wednesday. Getting Pedri back for the Atletico tie changes the entire complexion of that midfield battle.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Dani Olmo saga that consumed so much oxygen in January is finally, mercifully, over. The club confirmed this morning that his registration paperwork cleared La Liga's financial fair play deadline, meaning he's fully available for the rest of the season without any lingering legal clouds. It's the kind of administrative victory that shouldn't feel like news, but given how close the whole thing came to going sideways, there's genuine relief in the building.</p>
        <p>The La Liga table makes for pleasant reading: six points clear of Real Madrid, who still have to navigate a tricky trip to Mestalla this weekend, and eight ahead of Atletico. It's the kind of cushion that lets Flick manage his squad with Wednesday in mind without worrying about the gap shrinking overnight.</p>
        <p>All eyes now turn to the Metropolitano. Atletico without Barrios, Barca potentially with Pedri back, and a Copa del Rey final spot on the line. After a professional if unglamorous night's work against Mallorca, that's exactly where Flick wants his squad's energy focused.</p>
