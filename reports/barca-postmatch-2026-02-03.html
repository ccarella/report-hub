          <li>Scoreline: Albacete 1–2 Barcelona — Lewandowski brace overturns early scare in Copa del Rey.</li>
          <li>Goals: Lewandowski (54', 78') for Barca; Rubio (19' pen) for Albacete. Assists from Yamal and Gündogan.</li>
          <li>Man of the Match: Robert Lewandowski — led the line, dragged Barca back into a tie that was drifting away.</li>
          <li>Key stat: Barca finished with 73% possession, 18–6 in shots and 2.3–0.8 in xG after a flat first half.</li>
          <li>Biggest takeaway: Even on an off night, Barca’s senior spine and Flick’s in-game tweaks were enough to survive a tricky Copa away day.</li>
          <li>Season context: Progress secured to the next Copa round, rotation minutes banked, and momentum preserved ahead of the Atleti semi-final.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are Copa nights you remember for the football and Copa nights you remember because you simply got out alive. Barcelona’s 2–1 win away to Albacete firmly belongs in the second category, but that doesn’t make it any less valuable.</p>
        <p>Hansi Flick rolled the rotation dice again, protecting key legs before the looming semi-final with Atlético Madrid. The gamble nearly backfired. Barca’s first half was a familiar cocktail of slow circulation, loose passing in buildup and a front line that looked half a beat off the pace. Albacete, roared on by a packed Carlos Belmonte, sensed it and played with the freedom of a side with nothing to lose.</p>
        <p>The opening goal summed up Barca’s sloppiness. A lazy pass from Christensen into midfield was picked off, Pau Cubarsí arrived a fraction late trying to clean up the mess, and Rubio went down under contact. VAR confirmed the penalty, Rubio buried it, and suddenly Barca were chasing a tie that was meant to be routine. For twenty minutes after the goal, they looked anything but in control.</p>
        <p>What kept the night from spiralling was the combination that has quietly become Barca’s security blanket: Yamal’s invention on the flank and Lewandowski’s relentlessness in the box. Even in a laboured first half, the teenager was the one player consistently asking questions, dragging markers wide and drawing fouls in dangerous areas. Lewandowski, for his part, kept occupying both centre-backs, even when service into him was poor.</p>
        <p>The equaliser just after the break felt inevitable once Barca finally raised the tempo. Flick’s tweak — pushing De Jong higher and instructing the full-backs to overlap more aggressively — pinned Albacete deep. In the 54th minute, Yamal finally found daylight, skinned his man down the right and cut the ball back to the edge of the six-yard box where Lewandowski arrived on cue, sweeping past the keeper with his weaker foot.</p>
        <p>From there the game tilted decisively. Barca started winning second balls, Gündogan took control of the rhythm, and the chances stacked up: a João Félix curler inches wide, a De Jong header straight at the keeper, another Yamal cross begging to be finished. The risk, as always in these ties, was the sucker punch on the counter. Ter Stegen had to be sharp once, plunging low to his right to deny a rare Albacete break.</p>
        <p>The winner, when it came in the 78th minute, was pure centre-forward craft. Gündogan, now pulling strings between the lines, slipped a disguised pass into the inside-left channel. Lewandowski’s first touch took him across the defender, his second lashed the ball high at the near post. Two chances, two goals — the kind of ruthless edge Barca have lacked in too many cup ties over the past few seasons.</p>
        <p>Flick’s substitutions in the final quarter-hour were pragmatic rather than adventurous: Pedri and Araújo came on to shut the game down, and Barca settled into a controlled possession block that squeezed the life out of proceedings. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was professional. The only real drama in stoppage time came from the away bench, not the pitch.</p>
        <p>“This is exactly the type of match that builds character,” Flick said afterwards. “We rotated, we suffered, but the team found solutions together. In the Copa you don’t get style points, you get tickets to the next round.” Lewandowski echoed the sentiment, admitting that “we have to start games with more intensity,” but adding with a smile that “strikers live for nights like this.”</p>
        <p>In the grand arc of Barca’s season, this will register as a footnote rather than a headline, but it matters. The Copa remains one of the most realistic paths to a trophy, and progress here keeps the possibility of a domestic double alive. More quietly, it also keeps belief intact in a squad that has recently been grinding out results more than dazzling.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, Barca got what they came for without burning out the legs they most need in Madrid. Yamal added another 70 high-level minutes to his growing catalogue, De Jong and Gündogan escaped unscathed, and Lewandowski looked every inch the veteran match-winner. On nights like this, survival is the story — and Barca survived just fine.</p>
