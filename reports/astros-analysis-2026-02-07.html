        </ul>
        <p>The 2025 season was a reality check in Houston. After nearly a decade of treating October baseball as an annual rite of passage, the Astros finally ran out of margin for error. A rotation shredded by injuries, thin depth behind the stars and a division that no longer rolled over combined to snap their postseason streak that dated back to 2017.</p>
        <p>The front office’s response this winter has been clear: this is a reload, not a rebuild. Instead of tearing down, Houston focused on insulating its biggest weakness — the pitching staff — while trusting that a still-strong position-player core can carry a playoff-caliber offense.</p>
        <p>Start with the arms. Last year, the Astros were forced to lean too hard and too often on patchwork solutions when established starters went down. The organization has spent much of this offseason adding rotation and bullpen depth, headlined by moves like acquiring right-hander Kai-Wei Teng from the Giants. Teng isn’t a frontline name, but he’s the kind of controllable, strike-throwing arm that can soak up meaningful innings in the middle or back of a rotation, or serve as a multi-inning option out of the bullpen.</p>
        <p>That kind of depth matters because the top of Houston’s staff is still built around familiar names with high ceilings and real health questions. Framber Valdez and Cristian Javier remain the anchors; when right, both can pitch like number-two starters on a contender, missing bats while generating the kind of weak contact that plays in any ballpark. The problem in 2025 wasn’t talent, it was availability. The 2026 Astros don’t need Valdez and Javier to be Cy Young candidates — they just need 50–55 turns between them instead of a revolving door.</p>
        <p>Behind them, Houston will mix and match. Internal options who were pushed into outsized roles last season may be better suited as fifth starters or swingmen, and that’s exactly how the staff now profiles. If even one depth play clicks — a Teng, a prospect who forces his way into the picture, or a rebound from an arm coming off a down year — the entire run-prevention unit looks more stable.</p>
        <p>The bullpen, long an Astros strength, also figures to be a lever the club pulls aggressively. Names like Bryan Abreu and other late-inning options give the team latitude to shorten games, but the bigger story is volume: the more functional starters Houston has, the less often the relief corps is exposed in the fifth and sixth innings. Expect an emphasis on defined roles early in the season, with the flexibility to ride the hot hand as the year unfolds.</p>
        <p>On the position-player side, this roster still looks like an Astros team. Jose Altuve remains the emotional engine and table-setter, even as he moves into the later stages of his career. Yordan Alvarez is one of the most dangerous left-handed bats in the league, capable of carrying the offense for weeks at a time. Around them, Houston has quietly built a group of versatile contributors — players who can move around the diamond, lengthen the lineup and give the manager options when matchups dictate.</p>
        <p>The addition of Isaac Paredes via a one-year agreement with a 2027 option fits that mold perfectly. Paredes brings right-handed power, plate discipline and the ability to handle multiple infield spots. On a team that has at times been overly dependent on a small cluster of stars, his presence adds a different kind of threat: a hitter who can work counts, punish mistakes and lengthen the order from the middle of the lineup.</p>
        <p>There’s also reason to believe some of the younger or less-established pieces can take steps forward. Players like Jeremy Peña, Yainer Díaz and others in the 25–28 age band have already shown flashes of above-average production. If even one makes the leap from solid regular to borderline star, the offense shifts from "good" to "borderline elite" — especially in a year when some rivals in the AL West are retooling.</p>
        <p>Defensively, Houston should again be competent to slightly above average. Peña’s work at short, Altuve’s instincts at second and a generally athletic outfield group give the pitching staff a fair margin for error. The key is avoiding the kind of sloppy stretches that cropped up in 2025 when players were asked to play out of position due to injuries. With a healthier roster and more depth, the Astros are better positioned to keep everyone where they can succeed.</p>
        <p>Context matters, too. The AL West remains competitive, but it’s not the gauntlet it once was. Division rivals have their own questions — about aging cores, top-heavy payrolls or lack of depth — and there is no obvious 98-win juggernaut on paper. That opens the door for a team like Houston, whose median projection sits somewhere in the mid-to-high 80s in wins, to push back into the 90s if a few things break right.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the 2026 Astros season will be defined by health, depth and whether the organization’s bet on continuity still has one more run left in it. The core that delivered so many deep Octobers isn’t what it was in 2019, but it isn’t finished either. If the rebuilt pitching staff holds together and the lineup gets its usual star-level production from Altuve and Alvarez with real support around them, Houston has every chance to turn last year’s step back into a one-year blip rather than the start of a decline.</p>
        <p>The window may be narrowing, but it hasn’t slammed shut. The Astros enter 2026 as a proud, battle-tested club with something to prove — and that combination has been dangerous for the rest of the league before.</p>
