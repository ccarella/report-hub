        </ul>
        <p>For seventy minutes this felt like a training exercise. Then Vedat Muriqi reminded everyone why you never switch off against a team with nothing to lose, and Camp Nou had to clench for the final stretch. Barcelona 2, Mallorca 1 — a result that flatters the visitors slightly but tells you everything about where this Barca team is right now: good enough to control games, still learning how to kill them.</p>
        <p>Lamine Yamal's opener was the highlight of the night. Picking up the ball on the right flank in the 23rd minute, he shifted inside past two defenders and curled a left-footed shot into the far corner with the casual precision of someone who's done it a thousand times in training. He probably has. At 18, the scary thing about Yamal isn't the talent — everyone can see that — it's the decision-making. He knew the pass to Fermín López was on, he knew the overlap from the full-back was available, and he chose to shoot anyway. He was right.</p>
        <p>Frenkie de Jong's goal was pure instinct. A scramble in the box following a corner, bodies everywhere, and De Jong arriving late to prod the ball home from six yards. It wasn't pretty. It didn't need to be. De Jong has quietly added these kinds of goals to his game this season — the midfielder who arrives in the box at the right moment — and it's a dimension Flick has actively encouraged. "I want my midfielders to be a goal threat," Flick said post-match. "Frenkie understands this now."</p>
        <p>The comfortable 2-0 cushion allowed Flick to manage minutes. Pablo Torre replaced Fermín López on the hour, and Ansu Fati came on for Yamal with twenty minutes left. The intention was clearly to coast. Mallorca had other ideas.</p>
        <p>Muriqi's header in the 78th minute was almost inevitable. The Kosovan striker had been winning aerial duels all night — seven in total, more than any other player on the pitch — and when the cross came in from Maffeo on the right, he rose above Alejandro Balde and powered it past Iñaki Peña. Suddenly Mallorca had oxygen and Barca had to defend.</p>
        <p>This is where Pau Cubarsi earned his man-of-the-match billing. Three clearances in the final ten minutes, two won headers against Muriqi, and a crucial block on a Virgili shot in the 87th minute that was heading for the bottom corner. The 18-year-old is playing with the composure of someone a decade older. He doesn't panic, doesn't dive in, and reads the flight of the ball like a veteran. If Barca can pair him with a top left-footed center-back this summer, the defensive foundation is set for years.</p>
        <p>The final whistle brought relief more than elation. Flick acknowledged it in his press conference: "The last fifteen minutes were not what we wanted. We need to learn to manage games better at 2-0. But three points, no injuries, and the squad is ready for Wednesday. That was the objective tonight."</p>
        <p>He's right. This was always about Wednesday. The Copa del Rey semi-final at the Metropolitano is the real test, and on that front, mission accomplished: three points banked, key players rested, and Pedri one step closer to returning. The Mallorca win won't live long in the memory, but it doesn't need to. It just needed to be done, and it was.</p>
