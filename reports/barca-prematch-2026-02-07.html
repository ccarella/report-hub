          <li>Copa del Rey semi-final first leg: Atletico Madrid vs FC Barcelona, Wednesday Feb 11, 2:00 PM CT on ESPN+</li>
          <li>Atletico are without Pablo Barrios (muscle injury) — their most important midfield presence this season</li>
          <li>Pedri returned to full training and is expected to be available; Gavi and Christensen remain out</li>
          <li>Simeone's side have lost just once at the Metropolitano all season (to Real Madrid in November)</li>
          <li>Barca have won 3 of the last 5 meetings, but both Copa ties in the last decade have gone to extra time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the fixture Barca have been building toward for weeks. The Copa del Rey semi-final first leg at the Metropolitano is the kind of game that defines seasons — not because the trophy itself is the priority, but because how you handle the big away nights tells you everything about where a team really is.</p>
        <p>Atletico Madrid under Simeone remain one of the most uncomfortable away trips in European football. The Metropolitano is loud, the pitch is immaculate, and the home side defend their box like it's a personal insult to concede. They've lost just once there all season — a 2-1 defeat to Real Madrid back in November — and even that required a 92nd-minute Bellingham winner.</p>
        <p>The confirmed absence of Pablo Barrios changes the equation significantly. Barrios has been Atletico's midfield engine this season: the player who does the ugly work that lets Griezmann and Julián Álvarez play with freedom. Without him, Simeone will likely turn to Koke for experience and composure, but Koke at 34 doesn't cover the same ground. Expect Marcos Llorente to be deployed in a more central role to compensate for the lost energy.</p>
        <p>For Barca, the big question is Pedri. He trained fully on Friday and all reports suggest he'll travel with the squad. If he starts, the midfield trio of Pedri, Frenkie de Jong, and Dani Olmo gives Flick arguably the most technically gifted middle three in Spain. That's a group capable of keeping the ball in tight spaces, resisting Atletico's press, and finding the pockets between the lines where Simeone's 5-3-2 can be vulnerable.</p>
        <p>If Pedri doesn't start, Fermín López slots in — and after a decent showing against Mallorca, he's earned some trust. But there's a difference between "decent against Mallorca" and "ready for the Metropolitano," and Flick knows it.</p>
        <p>Tactically, this comes down to transitions. Atletico want to defend deep, force Barca wide, and then explode on the counter through Álvarez and Griezmann. Barca want to control territory, tire Atletico's block with patient positional play, and create overloads through the half-spaces. The team that wins the transition battle — who gets set fastest after turnovers — will control the tie.</p>
        <p>The one thing Barca cannot afford is an early goal against. The Metropolitano gets louder, Simeone gets more animated, and suddenly the game turns into exactly the kind of arm-wrestle Atletico love. Keep it tight through 30 minutes, establish some control, and the away goal becomes a genuine possibility.</p>
        <p>Prediction: 1-1. Barca get the crucial away goal through De Jong, Griezmann equalizes from a set piece, and the tie goes back to Camp Nou finely balanced. Advantage Barca, but only just.</p>
