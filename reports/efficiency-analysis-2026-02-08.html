          <li>AI-assisted "vibe coding" raises the bar for what counts as value-adding work from human developers: framing problems, validating solutions, and designing systems.</li>
          <li>Efficiency improvements should focus on removing or automating handoffs, status work, and speculative building that users never feel.</li>
          <li>A simple test for value: could you explain the activity to a customer without embarrassment as a necessary part of creating or protecting value for them?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In classic operations thinking, every step in a process is either value-adding or non-value-adding. A value-adding step is one a customer would willingly pay for if they could see it happening; a non-value-adding step is everything else. The tricky part in software development is that almost none of our work is directly visible to customers. They do not watch us writing tickets, debating architecture, or refactoring a module. They only experience the outcomes: what the product lets them do, how reliably it works, and how quickly it improves in directions that matter to them.</p>
        <p>Chapter 5 on removing steps in a process is really about moral clarity: if a step does not create value for the customer, reduce risk of failure, or accelerate learning about what the customer values, we should be suspicious of it. That lens becomes especially important in modern software, where a lot of activity can feel productive while being largely theatrical. Sprints, ceremonies, elaborate diagrams, and meticulously groomed backlogs can all be forms of busywork if they are not tightly connected to better user outcomes.</p>
        <p>From a customer's perspective, value in software clusters around three things: capability, confidence, and continuity. Capability is what the software allows them to do that they could not do before, or can now do faster, cheaper, or with less cognitive load. Confidence is how much they trust the system to behave, protect their data, and not surprise them in bad ways. Continuity is the sense that the product will keep improving in ways that align with their needs rather than stagnating or thrashing.</p>
        <p>When you map these to development activities, value-adding steps become clearer. Activities that directly produce or refine a capability the user will feel are value-adding. So are activities that materially reduce the risk of a bad outcome for the user: good testing, thoughtful observability, real incident postmortems, and security work that prevents outages or breaches. Finally, work that increases the flow of validated learning&mdash;talking to users, running experiments, instrumenting features to see how they are used&mdash;is value-adding because it keeps the product pointed in the right direction.</p>
        <p>By contrast, many common practices turn out to be non-value-adding or only indirectly valuable. Status meetings that exist because they have always existed. Manual deployments that could be automated. Long requirements documents nobody reads or keeps up to date. Large speculative features built without small experiments. Refactors done primarily for aesthetic reasons rather than to enable new capabilities or reduce meaningful risk. These steps are often justified as "necessary" for coordination or quality, but if you cannot draw a clear line from the activity to user outcomes, they are candidates for removal or radical simplification.</p>
        <p>This is where the current wave of AI-assisted development and "vibe coding" comes in. When a model can generate plausible code, scaffolds, and even entire services from a sketch, a lot of traditional software labor starts to look like non-value-adding work. If a human spends hours doing something that the model can do in minutes with similar quality, the human's activity is not magically value-adding just because it involves code. The value now shifts to framing the problem well, choosing the right tradeoffs, validating the solution with users, and ensuring the system behaves reliably over time.</p>
        <p>In a "magenta software" world where much of the surface-area coding can be automated or accelerated, the most important human work concentrates around three areas. First, understanding context: the messy, domain-specific realities that models do not see. Second, designing interfaces, workflows, and data structures that align with human goals, not just technical elegance. Third, building feedback loops so the team constantly learns what users actually value and can adapt quickly. These are all value-adding because customers feel their effects in the form of better fit, fewer surprises, and faster improvement.</p>
        <p>That does not mean we can or should eliminate all internal-facing activities. Some steps that do not look like value to a customer are still necessary to make the system safe and sustainable: compliance work in regulated domains, thoughtful documentation for operational continuity, and investments in platform reliability. The key is to be honest about their role. They are value-preserving or risk-reducing, and the justification should be expressed in those terms rather than in vague notions of "engineering hygiene." When such work is clearly tied to preventing user-hurting incidents or unlocking future speed, it earns its place in the process.</p>
        <p>For teams thinking in terms of removing steps, a useful discipline is to periodically map an end-to-end feature journey and classify each step as value-adding, risk-reducing, learning-accelerating, or neither. Steps in the fourth category are prime candidates for deletion, automation, or aggregation. Standing status meetings become a short written update. Manual testing flows become scripted checks plus a thin exploratory layer. Heavy upfront design documents give way to just-enough design plus instrumented experiments.</p>
        <p>A simple test helps keep you honest: imagine explaining a given step to a sophisticated but impatient customer. If you would feel comfortable saying, "We do this because it is the safest way to ensure your data stays secure," or "This is how we make sure new features actually solve your problem before we roll them out broadly," you are likely in value-adding territory. If, on the other hand, your explanation sounds like, "We have this meeting because otherwise everyone might not be aligned," or "We like to keep the codebase really clean," you might be looking at a non-value-adding step that survived by habit.</p>
        <p>As AI tools keep eating more of the mechanical parts of software development, the distinction between value-adding and non-value-adding work will only sharpen. Teams that cling to rituals for their own sake will feel increasingly slow and expensive. Teams that aggressively remove or automate non-value steps, while deepening their investment in understanding customers and validating outcomes, will feel fast and precise. Efficiency, in this sense, is not doing the same work faster; it is ruthlessly concentrating human attention on the parts of the process a customer would actually recognize as worth paying for.</p>
