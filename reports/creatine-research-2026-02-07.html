          <li>Across randomized trials, creatine supplementation shows small but real benefits for short-term memory and reasoning, especially in sleep-deprived, stressed, or older adults and in vegetarians.</li>
          <li>Effects on other cognitive domains (attention, reaction time, executive function) are mixed, with several studies showing no measurable changes in young, well-rested omnivores.</li>
          <li>Most cognition-focused trials use 5 g/day of creatine monohydrate, which appears safe long term in people with healthy kidneys when paired with adequate hydration.</li>
          <li>Brain creatine levels change slowly; a consistent daily dose builds and maintains stores better than “on workdays only” supplementation.</li>
          <li>If you only take creatine 5 days/week, you probably maintain most benefits once your brain pool is saturated, but daily use is the more evidence-aligned pattern.</li>
          <li>Anyone with kidney disease, a significant medical history, or polypharmacy should clear chronic creatine use with their clinician first, even at 5 g/day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Creatine is best known as a strength and sprint performance supplement, but it has been quietly accumulating evidence on the cognitive side as well. The brain is a high-energy organ, and the same phosphocreatine system that buffers ATP in muscle also operates in neurons. Raising brain creatine stores may support cognition under energy stress — sleep deprivation, intense mental workload, or aging-related energetic decline.</p>
        <p>Most of the cognitive literature clusters into three groups: young healthy adults, older adults, and individuals under stressors such as sleep deprivation or vegetarian diets (which start with lower baseline creatine intake). A systematic review of randomized controlled trials in healthy participants found that oral creatine supplementation tends to improve short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning tasks, while results for other domains like attention, reaction time, and executive function are inconsistent. In several studies, young, well-rested omnivores showed little or no measurable change, suggesting a ceiling effect when baseline brain energy availability is already high.</p>
        <p>By contrast, older adults and individuals with lower dietary creatine intake display more robust effects. Trials in elderly participants using higher daily loads have reported improvements in memory tasks and general cognitive performance. Vegetarian participants, whose baseline creatine intake is near zero, also show larger gains on memory measures after supplementation than meat-eating controls. Together, these patterns support the idea that creatine’s cognitive benefits are greatest when the brain is operating closer to its energetic limits.</p>
        <p>In terms of dosing, many cognition-focused trials use 5 g/day of creatine monohydrate, sometimes following an initial loading phase and sometimes as a straight daily maintenance dose. This 5 g/day figure has become a de facto standard in sports nutrition as well: it is enough to gradually saturate muscle and (more slowly) brain creatine stores over several weeks without the gastrointestinal issues that occasionally appear at higher loading doses. Safety data in healthy individuals on multi-month and even multi-year use of 3–5 g/day are reassuring, with no consistent signal of kidney harm when renal function is normal and fluid intake is adequate.</p>
        <p>For brain outcomes in particular, the time course matters. Creatine distribution into the central nervous system is slower than into skeletal muscle, and the transporter across the blood–brain barrier appears to saturate. That means brain creatine levels accumulate gradually with regular dosing, then reach a new steady-state and decline slowly if intake stops. From a mechanistic standpoint, this favors consistent daily intake over intermittent dosing if the goal is cognitive support rather than short-term gym performance.</p>
        <p>The practical question is whether you must take creatine seven days per week or can confine it to the five workdays when you care most about mental performance. Once tissue stores are saturated, missing occasional doses will not collapse your brain creatine levels — you are working against a slow leak, not an on/off switch. A pattern like five days on, two days off is unlikely to erase benefits entirely, especially after several weeks of daily use have built up your stores.</p>
        <p>However, the available trials and mechanistic logic both point toward daily dosing as the cleaner, more evidence-aligned strategy. Studies that report cognitive benefits typically use consistent daily supplementation over weeks to months. Because the system is driven by steady-state levels rather than acute spikes, skipping weekend doses trades a small amount of simplicity for slightly less predictable tissue levels, with no clear upside other than habit convenience.</p>
        <p>Safety is the other axis of the decision. In otherwise healthy people with normal kidney function, 5 g/day of creatine monohydrate is widely regarded as a low-risk intervention, provided you maintain hydration and avoid stacking it with other nephrotoxic stressors. That said, anyone with a history of kidney disease, hypertension with end-organ involvement, or complex medication regimens should treat long-term creatine use like any chronic supplement: something to clear with their physician or nephrologist, not a casual add-on.</p>
        <p>Putting this together, the mental case for creatine looks like this: small-to-moderate benefits for short-term memory and reasoning, with the biggest upside in older, stressed, or lower-intake individuals, built on top of a decent safety profile at 5 g/day in healthy adults. Because brain creatine behaves like a slow-moving reservoir, a daily 5 g dose is the most straightforward way to build and maintain that reservoir. A five-days-only plan will probably keep you above baseline once you are saturated, but if you want to align with how the trials were run — and minimize variability in your cognitive "floor" — taking it seven days a week is the more defensible choice, pending individual medical clearance.</p>
