          <li>Classic scaling stories in manufacturing show that efficiency gains come less from raw horsepower and more from reorganizing work, supply chains, and feedback loops.</li>
          <li>OpenAI is pursuing a mass-market, "consumer internet" style scaling path, pushing cheap or ad-supported access to AI as a general-purpose utility.</li>
          <li>Anthropic is pursuing a more focused, enterprise-first path, optimizing for reliability, governance, and integration depth over sheer user count.</li>
          <li>Both strategies mirror historic tradeoffs between volume and margin: OpenAI leans toward scale economies, while Anthropic leans toward scope and trust economies.</li>
          <li>As AI matures, the real efficiency frontier will be in how organizations reorganize around AI agents, not just in model size or raw inference throughput.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>When people talk about "scaling" AI, they usually mean bigger models and more GPUs. In classic industrial history, though, thats only the first, most obvious layer of efficiency. The deeper story in works like "The Origins of Efficiency" is that production really transformed when firms reshaped how work was organized: standardizing components, tightening feedback loops between design and the shop floor, and building supply chains that made high throughput predictable instead of heroic.</p>
        <p>That lens is useful for looking at todays AI industry, especially the contrast between OpenAIs mass-market pushincluding an advertising-supported tierand Anthropics more measured, enterprise-focused approach. Both are doing the obvious scaling work (bigger clusters, better inference serving), but the interesting part is how they are trying to convert raw compute into durable production efficiency for themselves and for their customers.</p>
        <p>In the classic manufacturing arc, the first wave of efficiency comes from mechanization: swapping human muscle for machines. The second, larger wave comes from systematization: rearranging factories into flow lines, introducing interchangeable parts, and designing products with manufacturability in mind. The third wave comes from organizational learning: statistical quality control, just-in-time inventory, and continuous improvement. At each step, the unit cost falls not just because machines get better, but because the whole system is redesigned around what the machines are good at.</p>
        <p>OpenAIs current strategy looks a lot like the consumer-goods side of that story. By pushing toward mass-market accesseven flirting with ad-supported AI for "everyone" it is betting that the biggest efficiency gains come from scale: more users generating more data, more usage patterns to learn from, and more surface area to monetize. This is analogous to a manufacturer building massive, highly automated plants and then trying to run them as close to capacity as possible. The marginal cost of an additional inference drops as you fill the line.</p>
        <p>In that model, the real production system is not just the model weights and GPU cluster; its the entire distribution stack: client apps, APIs, recommendation surfaces, and monetization channels. Efficiency comes from amortizing fixed costs over huge volumes and continuously optimizing the funnel from "first use" to "habit" to "revenue-generating workload." The risk, as we saw in consumer tech, is that you can end up optimizing for attention and engagement rather than for durable value, especially if the ad-supported logic dominates.</p>
        <p>Anthropic, by contrast, is closer to the high-precision manufacturing or industrial equipment side of the analogy. It targets enterprises willing to pay for reliability, safety, and governance guarantees. Instead of chasing maximal user count, it tries to deepen each relationship: better controls, clearer safety profiles, audited behavior, and tight integration into existing business processes. This looks less like a giant consumer factory and more like a network of tailored production cells that produce fewer units but with higher margins and stronger switching costs.</p>
        <p>In manufacturing terms, OpenAI optimizes for economies of scale; Anthropic optimizes for economies of scope and trust. Scale economies favor standardized, one-size-fits-most products and aggressive cost reduction. Scope and trust economies favor modular platforms that can be adapted to many contexts and that minimize the risk of catastrophic failure. Just as some firms built fortunes selling commodity steel while others specialized in precision components or industrial systems, both AI strategies can be rational responses to the same underlying technology curve.</p>
        <p>"The Origins of Efficiency" also emphasizes that the most durable efficiency gains come when customers reorganize their own operations around the new production technology. Thats where both OpenAI and Anthropic face the same structural challenge: models are getting better fast, but most organizations still work like pre-AI factories, bolting AI on at the edges instead of redesigning workflows for agents that can perceive, decide, and act.</p>
        <p>If OpenAI succeeds in putting AI in front of everyone, it can catalyze that reorganization from the bottom up. Individual workers and teams will discover high-leverage uses on their own, and some fraction of that will filter back into official processes. The upside is huge discovery and a massive long tail of use cases. The downside is chaos: fragmented tools, inconsistent governance, and a long period where AI is everywhere but deeply under-integrated.</p>
        <p>Anthropics enterprise-first path is more top-down. The focus on safety, interpretability, and contractual guarantees is designed to make it easier for large firms to formally redesign processes around AI without blowing up their risk profile. That can slow initial adoption  procurement cycles and risk reviews are real  but once a system is embedded, it tends to stick. This mirrors how industrial firms standardized on particular equipment vendors or process-control systems for decades.</p>
        <p>Over time, the efficiency frontier in AI will likely look less like "who has the biggest model" and more like "who has the best production system for turning models into reliable workflows." That includes everything from tool-calling and agents, to observability and debugging, to pricing structures that make experimentation cheap but production predictable. OpenAI can use its mass-market position to learn quickly at scale and then package those learnings into platform features. Anthropic can use its enterprise relationships to co-design deeper systems with fewer but more demanding customers.</p>
        <p>For operators and builders, the main lesson from the industrial scaling story is to treat AI not just as a bigger machine, but as a chance to redesign how work flows. That means focusing less on which frontier model you use and more on where you can create stable, repeatable agentic loops that are observable, improvable, and composable with the rest of your stack. Whether you align more with OpenAIs mass distribution or Anthropics premium positioning, the leverage will come from the same place: disciplined experimentation, tight feedback loops, and an organization willing to reorganize itself around what this new kind of machine can actually do.</p>
        <p>In other words, the real "origins of efficiency" in AI wont be the next 10x model; it will be the firms that treat AI as infrastructure and rebuild their production systems accordingly, using whatever mix of mass-market and premium providers best matches their risk, margin, and differentiation goals.</p>
